## Session: Initial Setup & Reorganization

### What was done
- Verified project runs correctly (Astro v5.17.3, Tailwind CSS v4, localhost:4321)
- Renamed workspace from clawstrack-3rd to clawstrack
- Flattened folder structure: moved project files from nested clawstrack/ subdir to workspace root
- Removed orphaned .astro and node_modules artifacts that existed at the old root
- Reorganized src/ by extracting components and scripts from monolithic index.astro:
  - Created src/components/StarsCell.astro (live GitHub stars with bar graph)
  - Created src/components/FeatureCell.astro (boolean ● / ○ indicator)
  - Created src/components/SectionHeader.astro (table section divider)
  - Created src/scripts/github-stars.ts (client-side star fetcher, extracted from inline <script>)
- Updated package.json name from "os-compare" to "clawstrack"
- Created CLAUDE.md and .cursor/rules/agent.md (project guides, kept in sync)
- Created this progress.txt file

### Key decisions
- Kept Astro content collections as the data source (one JSON file per project) rather than switching to a CMS or API — keeps things simple and version-controlled
- Tailwind v4 uses CSS-based @theme config in global.css, not a tailwind.config.js — this is the v4 way
- Components are scoped to table-level primitives (cells, headers) rather than a single monolithic table component — better for reuse as the matrix grows
- Client-side GitHub API calls (unauthenticated) are fine for now but will hit rate limits at ~60 req/hr

### Learnings
- Astro v5 content collections use type: 'data' for JSON/YAML (not 'content' which is for Markdown)
- Tailwind v4 dropped tailwind.config.* in favor of @theme {} blocks inside CSS
- The project auto-expands columns when new JSON files are added to src/content/projects/ — no template changes needed
- Astro <script src="..."> tags reference files that get bundled by Vite automatically

## Session: Replace Projects — Web Frameworks → AI Assistant Ecosystem

### What was done
- Removed old project data: astro.json, nextjs.json (web framework comparisons)
- Added 7 new AI assistant/agent projects:
  - OpenClaw (openclaw/openclaw) — the original, 237k stars, TypeScript
  - NanoClaw (qwibitai/nanoclaw) — lightweight alternative with container isolation, 16k stars
  - nanobot (HKUDS/nanobot) — ultra-lightweight Python alternative, 26k stars
  - PicoClaw (sipeed/picoclaw) — Go rewrite targeting $10 hardware, 21k stars
  - Pi (badlogic/pi-mono) — AI agent toolkit with coding agent CLI, 18k stars
  - IronClaw (nearai/ironclaw) — Rust rewrite focused on privacy/security, 4k stars
  - ZeroClaw (zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) — Rust runtime OS for agentic workflows, 21k stars
- Redesigned content schema: replaced web framework features (ssr, fileBasedRouting, serverActions)
  and security fields (twoFactorRequired, scorecard) with AI assistant features:
  multiChannel, sandboxIsolation, memorySystem, scheduledTasks, mcpSupport, webSearch, webUI, agentSwarms
- Added `language` field to schema (string, not boolean — rendered as text cell)
- Updated index.astro: new feature rows with alternating row backgrounds, project names
  now link to their GitHub repos, removed Security & Compliance section
- Installed sharp@0.33.5 to fix pre-existing build error

### Key decisions
- Feature booleans were determined by reading each project's README and GitHub metadata
- Dropped security section (OpenSSF scorecard, 2FA) — not meaningful for this project set without real data
- Added Language as a top-level text row alongside License rather than a boolean feature
- Header project names now link to GitHub repos for quick navigation
- Column min-width reduced from 200px to 160px to better fit 7 columns

### Learnings
- GitHub API returns "NOASSERTION" for license when the LICENSE file doesn't match a known SPDX pattern (picoclaw)
- These "claw" projects form a clear ecosystem: OpenClaw is the reference, others are lightweight alternatives in various languages (TS, Python, Go, Rust)
- The content collection auto-expansion pattern works perfectly — adding 7 JSON files required zero template logic changes beyond the feature rows

## Session: Add X Account and Version per Project

### What was done
- Added `version` and `xAccount` (optional) to content schema
- Populated each project with latest release version from GitHub API
- Populated X handles from READMEs and GitHub org/user metadata: openclaw, qwibitai, SipeedIO, badlogicgames, zeroclawlabs
- nanobot and IronClaw have no public X account — display "—" when empty
- NanoClaw has no releases — version shown as "—"
- Added Version and X (Twitter) rows to comparison table; X links to x.com profile

## Session: Add Memory System per Project

### What was done
- Added `memorySystemType` (optional string) to content schema
- Added "Memory System" row to comparison table showing implementation details per project
- Populated from READMEs: OpenClaw (workspace filesystem), NanoClaw (CLAUDE.md per group), nanobot (memory.py), PicoClaw (MEMORY.md), IronClaw (PostgreSQL + pgvector), ZeroClaw (pluggable trait-based), Pi (—)

## Session: Release metadata and Scrapling watcher skill

### What was done
- Removed header badge (version/date) from layout
- Added `latestReleaseDate`, `projectAgeMonths`, and line-based `codeSize` to project data and table
- Added "Latest Release", "Project Age (months)", and clarified "Code Size (lines)" rows
- Created `src/pages/releases.astro` as a landing page for release summaries
- Added skill `.cursor/skills/watch-releases-scrapling/SKILL.md` to monitor GitHub releases with Scrapling and update release data
